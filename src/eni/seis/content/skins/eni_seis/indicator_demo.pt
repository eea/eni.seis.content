        <p>
In 2017, the share of protected areas is 6.4% of the total territory of the Republic of Moldova. Republic of Moldova is still far from reaching to national target of 10% of the country’s territory under the protected areas, neither Aichi target 11 of the Convention of Biological Diversity, which sets 17 % of terrestrial and inland water to be protected by 2020.

      <h3>Development with the designation of nationally protected areas as a tool for biodiversity conservation</h3>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="./images/image-demo-indicator1.png" />
        <p class="image-caption">Since 1971 protection of biodiversity through development of protected areas has been implemented in the Republic of Moldova. In the beginning, only a slight portion of the country’s territory was under protection. However, starting from early 1998 Moldova has been establishing the legal framework for developing and expanding the protected areas network across the country. Despite the total number of the protected areas has not changed substantially over the time, by means of  expanding boundaries of the protected areas with inclusion of wetlands and biosphere reserves, the area of nationally designated protected sites has been remarkably expanded from 664.7 km2 in 1998 up to  2107 km2 in 2018. This corresponds 6.4% of the country territory today. In 2018, the Republic of Moldova holds 311 protected sites in the country.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Despite all efforts, designation of protected areas is not solely a guarantee of biodiversity protection. Therefore, beyond this quantitative analysis, specific information on site management and quality would help to complete the assessment of affectiveness of the protected areas management. </p>
      <p>The Aichi target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to, by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape (See the Aichic target 11; <a href="https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/">https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/</a>). </p>
      <p>The national biodiversity strategy and action plan 2015-2020 aims to reach 10% of the country to be under protection including Emerald sites. With the coverage of 6.4% of its territory, the Republic of Moldova is still far from reaching to the national and  Aichi target 11. </p>

      <div class="image-container">

      </div>


      <p>The national designation types of protected areas considerably are varying in the Republic of Moldova. The protected area system of the country are dealing with twelfe different management categories from national parks to Zoos. The largest coverage of the protected areas (42%) are Ramsar sites followed by landscape reservations (18%) and national parks (17%). Scienctifi reserves (10%) and Biosphere reserves (8%) are also widely applied management categories in the country. </p>

      <p>Management categories of the nationally designated protected areas in the country still are not aligned with the IUCN management categories. Neither information on the overall objectives of various management categories are available, except those international designations such as ramsar sites and biosphere reserves. A GEF-UNDP fuınded project has been resulted –among others- with technical recommendation for aligment of the national designation types with the IUCN management categories but so far the implementation of those reccomendation is still pending (UNDP, 2013). </p>

      <p>The European Environment Agency jointly with the Council of Europe by means of  financial support of the EU Neighbourhood Partnership Program has been supporting the process of developing the Emerald network in the country since 2017. During 2017-2018, the Republic of Moldova has included
      52 new sites into the Emerald Network of the Bern Convention.</p>

      <h3 class="eni-section-title">Indicator Specification</h3>
      <h4>Indicator definition</h4>
      <p>The proposed definition is a combination of the D1 UNECE Environmental Indicator and of the SEBI 007 indicator.  </p>
      <p>The indicator shows the area of terrestrial area protected in compliance with the national legislation and its evolution over time. It reflects both the extent of protected areas and their share in the total area of the country.  </p>

      <p>The indicator can be further broken down by IUCN management categories and by category of national designation (national park, nature reserve, landscape park etc.). In addition, a sub-indicator showing the relation between nationally designated areas at national level and Emerald sites designation can be developed.</p>

      <h4>Units</h4>
      <p>Total area (km2) of nationally designated protected areas as a percentage of the country territory.</p>

      <h3 class="eni-section-title">Rationale</h3>
      <h4>Justification for indicator selection</h4>
      <p>Establishment of protected areas is a direct response to concerns over biodiversity loss, so an indicator in protected area coverage is a valuable indication of commitment to conserving biodiversity and reducing loss at a range of levels.</p>
      <p>The indicator demonstrates the change over time in one form of protection afforded to components of biodiversity. It provides a measure of the response to the degradation of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity in a country. It demonstrates the extent to which areas important for conserving biodiversity, cultural heritage, scientific research (including baseline monitoring of processes in the ecosystems), recreation, natural resource maintenance and other environmental values are protected.</p>
      <p>National biodiversity strategy and action plan of the Republic of Moldova has defined the expansion of the nationally desginated protected areas as one of the priority areas of work between 2015-2020.</p>

      <h4>Policy context description</h4>
      <p>The National Strategy on Biological Diversity and its Action Plan for 2015-2020 (NBSAP), 2015, provides policy framework for further capacity building and measures for conservation of biodiversity and improvement management and extension of protected areas in Moldova.
      https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/md/md-nbsap-v2-en.pdf</p>

      <p>The state-funded nature policy is promoted by the Law Nr. 1538 of 25.02.1998 on State-protected areas found.  This Law establishes the legal bases of the creation and functioning of the state-funded nature reserve, its principles, mechanism and mode of preservation, as well as the attributions of central and local public authorities, non-governmental organizations and citizens in this field.

      <p>The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aimed at the establishment and maintenance of comprehensive, effectively managed and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas. Under CBD, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 was adopted which requires that by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes (Target 11).</p>

      <h4>Targets</h4>
      <p>National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 2015-2020 of the Republic of Moldova set 10% of the country’s territory to be under protection by 2020.</p>

      <p>The Aichi target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity is set, by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.</p>

      <h3 class="eni-section-title">Methodology</h3>
      <h4>Methodology for indicator calculation (including description of data used)</h4>

      <p>Methodology for indicator calculation (including description of data used)</p>

      <p>It is necessary for this indicator to have a database of all nationally protected areas in the country, including name of the protected area, date of establishment, protection regime in accordance with national legislation (and relevant international requirements), size, digital boundaries.
      To breakdown results per IUCN management categories, it is necessary for each protected area to be characterized according to the type of management applied, following the IUCN guidelines.</p>

      <p>To assess the (spatial) complementarity between Emerald designation and nationally protected areas, two datasets are necessary (to be overlayed): 1) spatial delineation of nationally protected areas and 2) spatial delineation of Emerald sites (only Candidate and officially designated Emerald sites to be considered).</p>

      <p>Percentage of protected areas can be calculated by the formula: <br />
Share of protected areas (%) = (total area of protected areas in hectares or km2/ total area of the country in hectares or km2) × 100.
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology for gap filling</h4>
      <p>No methodology for gap filling has been specified.</p>

      <h4>Methodology references</h4>
      <p>The Law on Natural Areas Protected by the State (1998) provides the enabling legal framework for 12 different categories of protected areas in the republic of Moldova. Seven different national designation types are corresponding to the IUCN protected areas management categories (Scientific Reserve, National Park, Natural Monument, Nature Reserve, Landscape Reserve, Resource Reserve, Multifunctional Management Area) while three designation types are applied at the local scale i.e. dendrological garden, zoological garden and landscape monument. In addition, two international designation types are implemented for Biosphere Reserves and Ramsar sites.</p>

      <h3 class="eni-section-title">Uncertainties</h3>
      <h4>Methodology Uncertainty</h4>
      <p>The indicator "Progress in the designation of protected areas by IUCN categories over time" couldn’t be clearly defined as many national protected areas may include a territory with several IUCN categories. A specific definition of the IUCN category is possible by a separate expert assessment.</p>

      <h4>Data sets uncertainty</h4>
      <p>Republic of Moldova doesn’t regularly implement the UNECE environmental indicators in the country. Hence, there is no regular update of the database in the Republic of Moldova for developing this indicator. On the other hand, a slight inconsistency is subject between total area of the nationally designated protected areas and designation types per se.</p>
      <h4>Rationale uncertainty</h4>
      <p>The indicator does not describe the quality of management or whether or not the areas are protected from incompatible uses. The indicator needs to be complemented by information on management effectiveness or funding, or other elements that would indicate the potential of the designated area to protect biodiversity.</p>

      <h3 class="eni-section-title">Further work</h3>
